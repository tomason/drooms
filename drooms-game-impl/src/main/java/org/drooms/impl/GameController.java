/**
 * Provide a common ground for various types of games. We introduce a couple of
 * concepts and let the implementing classes specify the rules around those
 * concepts. The following concepts will be shared by all games extending this
 * class:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Each player gets one worm. Properties of these worms come from the game
 * config and will be explained later. List of players comes from the player
 * config.</li>
 * <li>When a worm collides with something, it is terminated. Collisions are
 * determined by classes extending this one.</li>
 * <li>When a worm's past couple decisions were all STAY (see {@link Move}), the
 * worm may be terminated. This is controlled by the classes extending this one.
 * </li>
 * <li>When a turn ends, worms may be rewarded for surviving. How and when, that
 * depends on the classes extending this one.</li>
 * <li>Terminated worms will disappear from the playground in the next turn.</li>
 * <li>In each turn, a collectible item of a certain value may appear in the
 * playground. These collectibles will disappear after a certain amount of
 * turns. Worms who collect them in the meantime will be rewarded. How often,
 * how valuable and how persistent the collectibles are, that depends on the
 * classes extending this one.</li>
 * <li>Upon collecting an item, the worm's length will increase by 1.</li>
 * <li>Game ends either when there are between 0 and 1 worms standing or when a
 * maximum number of turns is reached.</li>
 * <li>At the end of the game, a player whose worm has the most points is
 * declared the winner.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some of the decisions can be made by classes extending this one. These are
 * clearly described above. This class depends on properties as defined in
 * {@link GameProperties}.
 * </p>
